Universal Grapheme-to-Phoneme converter for Indian languages

1. Created a mapping for unicode code points and roman characters
2. Need to distinguish between independent (akshar) and dependent (maatra) 
based on name of the code
3. Convert independent signs first and then dependent signs.
4. Dependent signs apply to context following schwa (a).
5. For the nasal sign, a special rule is required since it can apply 
after all kinds of vowels and not just schwa.
6. Devnagari, Telugu, Malayalam and Gurmukhi (Punjabi) have similar 
code ranges, only differing in prefixes. Codes for these languages 
can be generated by transforming Devnagari codes. 
7. Usage of script:
python3 indicg2p.py --lang <dev/telugu/malayalam/gurmukhi> -- infile <hin_input.txt/tel_input.txt>
8. Requires python3
9. Scripts prints converted text to stdout
7. Tested using hin_input.txt and tel_input.txt. 

Issues:
1. Hindi mid vowel -ee not converted sometimes in the test file. 
2. what about word-final schwa deletion in Hindi?
